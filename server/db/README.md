== DB Installation ==

There are SQL two files in the folder:

  - install.sql
  - books.sql (optional)
  
The files `install.sql` is used to initialize a newly created database in a MySQL RDBMS.
You can create a brand new database with: 

  `CREATE DATABASE telbook CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;`
  
and then execute the script (copy/paste or import).

The file `books.sql` is for homework.
